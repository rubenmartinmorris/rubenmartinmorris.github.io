    <h1>All about HTML</h1>

    <h2>Basic info</h2>

    <p>HTML is a mark up language. <br>
      You use different 'tags' to tell the browser where things go and what they do or look like. </p>
    <p> At the top of the document you write ''&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;'' this will make sure that the browser recognises everything as new style html.</p>
    <p>Like in word we use h1-h6 to make different paragraph sizes and within these we use p for paragraphs. <br>
    other tags are &lt;br&gt; it simulates a break in the line</p>
    <p>It is important to write everything in the 'body part' of the html. You have a head with meta and title. Meta shows the type of characters the html will use<br>
      <p/>

    <h2>Highlighting and leaning words</h2>
    <p>To write bold you use the &lt;strong&gt; tag</p>
    <p>To write leaning you use the &lt;em&gt; tag</p>

    <h2>Now let us talk about lists:</h2>
    <h3>First we have the unordered list</h3>
    <p>obviously the tag is 'ul'. We put the following inside the list 'li'.
      <ul>
        <li>This is the first bulletpoint</li>
        <li>This is the second bulletpoint</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Next we have an ordered list with numbers</h3>
    <p>to start this list we use 'ol' and tag the lines with 'li' like before</p>
      <ol>
        <li>this if surrounded by li</li>
        <li>this is surrounded by li too</li>
        <li>don't you like the numbers?</li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Next we will learn to load an image</h3>
      <p> To do this we need to write the <strong>img</strong> tag. Then we write src="https://ad;flafjadfjkl"</p>
      <p> Next we need to write an alt. That means a text that is shown should the image not be available. alt=";lasdf;lasf"</p>
      <p> The next attribute we can add to img is the width or height of the picture. width=xxx </p>
      <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bhmd7lmONvQ/maxresdefault.jpg" alt ="This is HTML pic" width=200>
